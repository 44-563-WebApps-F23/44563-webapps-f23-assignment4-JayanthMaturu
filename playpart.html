        <p>Billing (lowering his voice). Aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a
            coward; there is nothing of the man in him. But this time you will
            insist on your own way, won't you? You will put the Doctor's article in?<br>
            
            Hovstad. Yes, and if the Mayor doesn't like it—<br>
            
            Billing. That will be the devil of a nuisance.<br>
            
            Hovstad. Well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account,
            whatever happens. If the Mayor will not fall in with the Doctor's
            project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on him—the whole of
            the Householders' Association and the rest of them. And if he does fall
            in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders
            in the Baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supporters—<br>
            
            Billing. Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty
            penny—<br>
            
            Hovstad. Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
            be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
            enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
            another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
            the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
            the Liberals.<br>
            
            Billing. That is perfectly true! I see it coming—I see it coming; we
            are on the threshold of a revolution!<br>
            
            (A knock is heard at the door.)<br>
            
            Hovstad. Hush! (Calls out.) Come in! (DR. STOCKMANN comes in by the
            street door. HOVSTAD goes to meet him.) Ah, it is you, Doctor! Well?<br>
            
            Dr. Stockmann. You may set to work and print it, Mr. Hovstad!<br>
            
            Hovstad. Has it come to that, then?<br>
            
            Billing. Hurrah!s<br>
