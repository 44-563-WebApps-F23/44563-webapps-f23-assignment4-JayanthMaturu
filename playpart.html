        <h1>Jayanth Maturu acts in a play</h1>
        <h3>An Enemy of the People</h3>
        <h4>Henrik Ibsen</h4>
        <h5 class="name Billing">Billing</h5> <p class="direction">(lowering his voice).</p> 
        <p class="speech Billing"> Aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a
            coward; there is nothing of the man in him. But this time you will
            insist on your own way, won't you? You will put the Doctor's article in?<br>
        </p> 
        <h5 class="name Hovstad">Hovstad.</h5> 
        <p class="speech Hovstad">Yes, and if the Mayor doesn't like it—
        </p><br>

        <h5 class="name Billing">Billing.</h5> 
        <p class="speech Billing">That will be the devil of a nuisance.
        </p><br>

        <h5 class="name Hovstad">Hovstad.</h5> 
        <p class="speech Hovstad">Well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account,
            whatever happens. If the Mayor will not fall in with the Doctor's
            project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on him—the whole of
            the Householders' Association and the rest of them. And if he does fall
            in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders
            in the Baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supporters—
        </p><br>
   
        <h5 class="name Billing">Billing.</h5> 
        <p class="speech Billing">Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty
            penny—
        </p><br>
   
        <h5 class="name Hovstad">Hovstad.</h5>
        <p class="speech Hovstad">Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
            be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
            enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
            another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
            the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
            the Liberals.
        </p><br>
    
        <h5 class="name Billing">Billing.</h5> 
        <p class="speech Billing">That is perfectly true! I see it coming—I see it coming; we
            are on the threshold of a revolution!

            street door. HOVSTAD goes to meet him.)</p> <p class="speech Hovstad">Ah, it is you, Doctor! Well?
        </p><br>
   
        <h5 class="name Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h5> 
        <p class="speech Stockmann">You may set to work and print it, Mr. Hovstad!

        <h5 class="name Hovstad">Hovstad.</h5> 
        <p class="speech Hovstad">Has it come to that, then?
